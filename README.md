## APIs Used 

For this assignment, we used two API's. We used the Bandsintown API so that you can search if an artist has any upcoming events. Then used the Spotify API so that you can listen to an artists top song.  

## Usage

Once you enter the website, input an artists name on the top right of the screen and click on the search button. Once you click on the search button, you will be informed on whether or not the artist has any upcoming events. If the artist has an upcoming event, you will be provided with a list of their upcoming events. If the artist has no upcoming events, you will be informed that the artist has no upcoming events. Lastly, if you search an artist that does not exist or misspelled an artists' name, you will be informed that there are no results found for that artist. To clear your search history, click on the clear button on the top right of the screen right next to the search button. To listen to an artist's top tracks, you might first need to request access by clicking on the link directly below the spotify container. Once you request access, you may click on one of the top tracks and you will be directed to Spotify. If you would like to see wether the top 10 streaming artists has any concerts, you can click on their name.
